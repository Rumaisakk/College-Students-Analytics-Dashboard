- Short forms (CSE, Comp Sci)
- Duplicate and redundant records

## 🔧 Data Preparation & Modeling
- Restructured dataset into 5 normalized tables
- Standardized text fields using Power Query
- Removed duplicates and corrected data types
- Built structured star-schema data model
- Developed optimized DAX measures for KPIs

## 📈 Dashboard Impact
- Improved data accuracy and consistency
- Reduced redundancy through normalization
- Enabled reliable KPI reporting
- Delivered interactive dashboard for decision-making

## 🛠 Tools Used
Power BI | Power Query | DAX | Data Modeling
